      <p>
      Our ambition is to effectively model real-world objects/situations to software objects/programs by designing, coding, analysing and visualizing.
      </p>
      <p>
      In order to do so, we need to have the right mindset and specific domain knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
      Let's continue the endeavour...
