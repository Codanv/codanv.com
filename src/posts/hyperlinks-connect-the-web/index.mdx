A hyperlink (link) is a text string, icon or graphic that references (ties) to another file via a [URL](/url-structure-in-brief) that the user can follow by clicking or tapping. It allows easy jumping from one document to another.  The [web](/world-wide-web-and-its-inception) is comprised of hyperlinks linking trillions of files to one another.

### Types of links

**Incoming links**
    
A link from someone else's webpage to your site. It's the opposite of an external link. Note that you don't have to link back when someone links to your site.

### Links and Search Engines
