**`QUICK BRIEF`** üîπ Linux!!! So this article is to set your mood for learning linux terminal commands. Here we have some funny linux commands to play with. let's get into play ground.

> This is one of article on linux terminal series.

![Feature](./matrix.png)

## Why does one even bother to learn linux commands?

You have graphical user interface with mouse. Perfect! But consider a scenario where you have to access remote computers without GUI. You get it. Linux Web Servers which are stripped of GUI (unnecessary) for the sake of performance.

Yea! It's obviously true that we are given web browser interfaces (cPanel or Plesk) to access web server resources (database, email, etc); but sometimes you need ful control over your resources. This is where we need the power of linux commands. sounds interesting? ü§î

> If you have not setup any linux distribution yet. Here is [online playground](https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?cpu=riscv64&url=fedora29-riscv-2.cfg&mem=256) (terminal). You might have other alternative. 

## Fun part begins here

### 1. cowsay
First, have somebody to speak and think on behalf of you. `cowsay` generates ascii picture of a cow with a desired message. **Let's install it.**

On debian based system
```bash
$ sudo apt install cowsay
```
<br />

On redhat/fedora
```bash
$ sudo dnf install cowsay
```
<br />

Let's call the speaker.

```bash
$ cowsay "I am on your behalf."
< I am on your behalf. >
 ----------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

```

<br />

You can even call **tux** instead of cow.

```bash
$ cowsay -f tux "Going other way."
< Going other way >
 -----------------
   \
    \
        .--.
       |o_o |
       |:_/ |
      //   \ \
     (|     | )
    /'\_   _/`\
    \___)=(___/

```

<br />

Your beast can think also. so try `$ cowthink "Busy ruminating!"`

> On running linux desktop you can have GUI cowsay `xcowsay`.<br />
> You can install xcowsay just as you did above. 

### 2. fortune

Let's get some fate. `fortune` is a program that displays a pseudorandom message from a database of quotations. **Let's get it.**

On debian based system
```bash
$ sudo apt install fortune
```
<br />

On redhat/fedora
```bash
$ sudo dnf install fortune-mod
```
<br />

> You can also try [Motivate](https://github.com/mubaris/motivate) as an alternative to fortune.

Let's see whats your fortune.

```bash
$ fortune 
The cow is nothing but a machine which makes grass fit for us people to eat.
	--- John McNulty

```

<br />
Let your beast say your fortune.


```bash
$ fortune | cowsay
 ________________________________________
/ You will inherit some money or a small \
\ piece of land.                         /
 ----------------------------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

```
<br />

> Above, vertical bar `|` passes the output of `fortune` to `cowsay` as input.
> Thats all for now!

Or even your beast can think of your fortune.

```bash
$ fortune | cowthink
( Always borrow money from a pessimist; )
( he doesn't expect to be paid back.    )
 ---------------------------------------
        o   ^__^
         o  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

```
<br />

> You can call `xcowsay` or `xcowthink` to say or think your fortune. <br />

It's wonderful, isn't it?

### 3. figlet

So you decided to have a banner along the beast. `figlet` is a program that creates a banner out of your text.

On debian based system
```bash
$ sudo apt install figlet
```
<br />

On redhat/fedora
```bash
$ sudo dnf install figlet
```
<br />

You and the beast looks excited to have your banner. Let's check your fortune.

```bash
$ figlet "Codanv"
 / ___|___   __| | __ _ _ ____   __
| |   / _ \ / _` |/ _` | '_ \ \ / /
| |__| (_) | (_| | (_| | | | \ V / 
 \____\___/ \__,_|\__,_|_| |_|\_/  

```
<br />

"So can I pass my fortune to banner?" -- Yes! of course.

```bash
$ fortune | figlet

```

Now, I'm excited to do some mathematics.
 
### 13. factor

"Factors! Let me check my own." -- Of course, with your attitude ü§î

Print the prime factors of each specified integer NUMBER.  If none are specified on the command line, read them from standard input.

```bash
$ factor 135
135: 3 3 3 5
$ factor 455 | cowsay -f dragon
< 455: 5 7 13 >

Great evolvement. Kudos!

We have had good start so far. üëç

Thats all for the first article on Linux terminal series! 

"ü§ó You just set the mood. Hum! Your next article covers [The Essentials of Linux Terminals](/posts/the-essentials-of-linux-terminal)." -- Thank You! You got the essence.

You are awesome! Really It's for you.
